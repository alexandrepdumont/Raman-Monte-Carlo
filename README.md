# Raman-Monte-Carlo
A program built atop the MCX infrastructure that uses the custom isoweight function to effectively simulate Raman scattering. 

The isoweight function is a new launch function that takes the excitation matrix, rasterizes it, cummulatively sums and normalizes to 1, and then uses the random number generation to query this line. 

More information is on offer in an upcoming paper.
